A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, 
thereby obscuring Earth's view of the Sun, totally or partially.
 Such an alignment coincides with a new moon, indicating the Moon is closest to
 the plane of the Earth's orbit.In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is 
 fully obscured by the Moon.
